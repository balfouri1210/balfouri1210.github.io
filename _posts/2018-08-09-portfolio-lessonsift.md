Make with learning.  
I was very beginning of frontend skills.  
All I know was basic HTML5 and CSS3.
So I had to learn from basic javascript to framework like AngularJS.  
At the same time, we had to make UI and design things so there were lots of things to do.

Anyway we tried it and finally we could make functional web service.  
At first, my role was UI/UX design but middle of project I made UI blueprint to real screen with publishing skills.  
And the last 5-6 months I was in charge of whole frontend development.  

- Build business logic with AngularJS  
- Made ajax calls with RestAPI  
- Applied open source like ui-router, Angular-i18n, momentJS etc.  
- Got Youtube meta data from Youtube data API
